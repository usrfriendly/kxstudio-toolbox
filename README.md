# kxstudio-toolbox

This is an OCI image based on Fedora/Toolox's Ubuntu container for use in container-oriented workflows with Distrobox.  It would probably work with docker.

This has been developed for personal use, but reach out if there are any issues/optimizations/improvements.

It is just a shell container that pre-installs the KXStudio repository.

Improvements:
Find a way to automate updating the repository file
Create a way to manage distro upgrades.  Weekly rebuilds should do this,
and trigger Thursdays to let me know how I'm spending my free time Friday.
